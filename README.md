## Intro
TuDu is a simple to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web-based browsers. The application allows users to create and manage their to-do lists in a clean and intuitive interface.

## Getting Started
To use TuDu, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The application should load and you can start creating your to-do list.

## Usage
TuDu is a simple and straightforward to-do list application. To create a new to-do item, simply type your task in the input field at the top of the screen and press Enter or click the "Add" button. To mark a task as complete, click the checkbox next to the task. To delete a task, click the "X" button next to the task.

## Improvements
Here are a few potential improvements that could be made to TuDu:

- Add the ability to organize tasks into categories or projects, so users can group related tasks together.
- Allow users to set due dates or reminders for tasks, so they can keep track of when tasks need to be completed.
- Provide a search feature, so users can easily find specific tasks within their to-do list.
- Add support for multiple users, so users can share their to-do lists with others or collaborate on tasks with colleagues or friends.
